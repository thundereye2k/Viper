1. Minetweak.jar is the custom spigot
2. Put Popura into the plugin folder
3. The .JAR files are in the folders. To easily get them just search .JAR
4. All files contain the src code
5. Upon loading the plugins you will recieve an error w/ Popura. It's because you need to hook into the MySQL database.
6. Enjoy!
